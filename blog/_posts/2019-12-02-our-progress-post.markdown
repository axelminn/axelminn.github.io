This week we did no need to present anything but we had some time just to focus on our game and take all the feedback that we have recived and iplement what we liked into our game. The geme development has been great and the group is very active in communication which is very importand in my opinion. Every team member is contributing a lot of work and ideas to make the final product as good as it can be. We have started to build a web site to promote our game and the game has impoved massively over previous days. We are haveing a great time to develop Waiting Wizards and to see our game evolving. 

We have spent much time on coding the game and finding the right concept art and overall look of the game. The game mechanics are also coming along very well and at this point we are just fine tuneing and adding new implementations. 

We have also started to write our GDD (Game Development Document) for our final hand in and everyone are contributing to the writing which is really good.
