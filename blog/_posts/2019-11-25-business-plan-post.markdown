Previous week we presented our business plan for our game, Waiting Wizards. We have decided to make Waiting Wizards a F2P (free to play) game and our revenue potential will be from in-game purchasing for different cosmetics and season passes. This will help our game to be very accessible and will help us to build a user base and a reputation more quickly because players do not need to commit any of their money to start playing. 
 
We are targeting people who like TBS(turn-based strategy) games and want to be able to jump in a simplified game where they can play with or against friends. The main goal is that the players have fun playing our game. 
 
Our business plan was well received, I mean who does not like free games.
