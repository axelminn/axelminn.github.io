On Friday (15. nov) we presented our game, Waiting Wizards. We had been working hard to have a playable demo for the presentation over the week and we really like the result. As of now there is much that needs to be added and improved but we have our core concept to build on. Our game is a TBS (turn-based strategy) game where the players control wizards that have different spells. The goal is to eliminate the other wizard. The feedback that we got is that the game looked good and interesting but we needed to differentiate more from other big games in the TBS genre. Overall the team is working great together and we have established a very efficient and good communication with messenger (facebook) and we have our workflow in Trello where we can create and assign work between group members.
