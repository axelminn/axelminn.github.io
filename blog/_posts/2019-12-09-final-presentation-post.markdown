Today is the final day for our project. We have been working long hours to have everything ready for the final presentation. We have our game finished (version 1.0), we have finished the GDD (game development document), the website is ready and we have a good presentation (slide show). I must say that I'm very pleased with the result and I'm really proud of my team for the final output of our project. 
 
I'm writing this blog before we will present our project but I hope it will go well. This course (DH2650) has been great and I have learned a lot of new skills. I have also met a lot of very interesting people and I'm grateful to get to know so many great individuals over this short period. 
 
Finally I just would like to say that my team is awesome.
 
Thanks for being awesome:
 
Marcus Andersson, 
Lisa Andersson LÃ³pez,
Eduardo Alvarez Nowak,
Diego Catalan Canales,
