  Alongside my interests in networks and software engineering some of my other interests and hobbies are:
   - Quality time with my family
   - Football
   - Movies
   - Gaming
   - Knitting
  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.
  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
